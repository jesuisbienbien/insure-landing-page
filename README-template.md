### What I learned

```css
*complex css selector: when the nav--item is hovered, nav--link text should change color*
.nav--item:last-of-type {
  border: 2px solid var(--very-light-gray);
  padding: 1rem 0 1rem;
  &:hover {
    background-color: var(--very-light-gray);
  }
}
.nav--item:last-of-type:hover .nav--link:last-of-type {
  color: var(--very-dark-violet);
}
```
